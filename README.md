Scaler Assignment: üìà NPS Data to Strategic Operations Framework
üéØ Project Goal
This repository showcases a comprehensive Data Analyst & Strategic Operations project completed as an assignment for Scaler.

The core objective was to transform inconsistent NPS (Net Promoter Score) support ticket data into actionable strategic insights, ultimately designing a sustainable monitoring system to drive operational excellence and improve learner experience.

‚ú® Key Project Phases & Contributions
The project covered the entire analytical lifecycle:

1. Data Quality & Governance Audit üßπ
Audit: Performed a deep audit to expose data inconsistencies, including missing critical information (dates/assignments), logical errors (Status-Sub-Status conflicts), and duplicate records.

Prevention: Designed forward-looking data validation rules and recommended standardized data entry procedures to guarantee future data integrity.

2. Strategic Pattern Analysis & Prioritization üß†
High-Impact Prioritization: Identified and analyzed the Top 5 most critical issue types based on a weighted score of frequency and impact.

Scope: Strategically distinguished between problems that were cross-program (systemic) and those that were program-specific (isolated).

Efficiency: Analyzed resolution time patterns by issue category and pinpointed the single fix with the largest positive leverage for learners.

Trends: Explored weekly/monthly ticket volume trends, issue distribution across programs, and assessed team performance (resolution efficiency).

3. Monitoring Framework Design ‚öôÔ∏è
Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Conducted deep-dive RCAs on the top 3 critical issues, mapping their origins directly back to operational processes.

KPI Dashboard: Developed a conceptual design for a KPI Dashboard, defining the core metrics, review cadence (weekly/monthly), required stakeholders, and clear escalation criteria.

Future-Proofing: Recommended process improvements and potential automation opportunities for sustained resource optimization and efficiency gains.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Core Analysis: Microsoft Excel (or equivalent Python/Pandas for typical workflow)

Documentation: Markdown (README)

Deliverable: Conceptual Dashboard Design & Monitoring Framework Document
